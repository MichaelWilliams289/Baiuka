This is my home base on the internet, where I share the things I like, whether it's about Linux, tech, politics, or my favorite game, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., a first-person-shooter survival horror video game. This website is inspired by [Eric Murphy](https://ericmurphy.xyz/) and [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz/)'s personal websites.
